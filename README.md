## Welcome to Stamp a mobile app for signing multi sig transaction from a QR code.

### Potential Uses

* Online Wallets. Stamp can be used as a safer form of 2 factor authentication.
* Online Market Places. A new wave of cryptocurrency marketplaces using multi sig transactions need an easy way for the user to sign the transaction.

### How ?

Basically Stamp is a Hierarchcal deterministic Bitcoin wallet that doesn't store any Bitcoins. Rather it can issue Master Public Keys and sign P2SH transactions created with those keys.

### Plan

1. Send a MPK after reading a QR code. DONE.
2. Sign a TX generated from a P2SH using the above key. IN PROGRESS
3. Fix up GUI and look and feel.
4. Test on iOS

### Proposed API

### Can I help ?

That would be great.
