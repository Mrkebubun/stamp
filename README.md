Welcome to Stamp a mobile app for signing multi sig transaction from a QR code.

Potential Uses

* Online Wallets. Stamp can be used as a safer form of 2 factor authentication.
* Online Market Places. A new wave of cryptocurrency marketplaces using multi sig transactions need an easy way for the user to sign the transaction.

How ?

Basically Stamp is a Hierarchcal deterministic Bitcoin wallet that doesn't store any Bitcoins. Rather it can issue Master Public Keys and sign P2SH transactions created with those keys.

Plan

Proposed API.
